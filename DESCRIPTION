Description: FUCHIKOMA detects differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in one of multiple clusters. To detect DEGs, FUCHIKOMA has two calculation mode; "supervised-mode" and "unsupervised-mode". In supervised-mode, FUCHIKOMA detects DEGs by using a label vector, in which the cluster of each sample or cell is written. In unsupervised-mode, FUCHIKOMA detects DEGs without the label vector. In this mode, user run the diffusion map, and specify which diffusion components contribute to the difference of such cluster.
